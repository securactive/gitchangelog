git-changelog
=============

Translate commit message history to a changelog.

Feature
-------

    -  fully driven by a small configuration file to match with your
       changelog policies. (see for example the `sample configuration
       file <http://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog/blob/master/gitchangelog.rc.sample>`__)

    -  ignore commit message based on regexp matching

    -  refactor commit message displayed on the fly with replace regexp

    -  classify commit message into sections (ie: New, Fix, Changes...)

    -  ignore non-changelog tags by regexps

    -  templates for different types of output (markdown, ReST, etc)

Sample
------

The output is currently fixed to ReSTructured text, but it should be readable is ASCII.

Here is a small sample of the ``git-changelog`` changelog at work.

Current ``git log`` output so you can get an idea of the log history:

::

    * 59f902a Valentin Lab new: dev: sections in changelog are now in the order given in ``git-changelog.rc`` in the ``section_regexps`` option.  (0.1.2)
    * c6f72cc Valentin Lab chg: dev: commented code to toggle doctest mode.
    * a9c38f3 Valentin Lab fix: dev: doctests were failing on this.
    * 59524e6 Valentin Lab new: usr: added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly body of commit.
    * 5883f07 Valentin Lab new: usr: use a list of tuple instead of a dict for ``section_regexps`` to be able to manage order between section on find match.
    * 7c1d480 Valentin Lab new: dev: new ``unreleased_version_label`` option in ``git-changelog.rc`` to change label of not yet released code.
    * cf29c9c Valentin Lab fix: dev: bad sorting of tags (alphanumerical). Changed to commit date sort.
    * 61d8f80 Valentin Lab fix: dev: support of empty commit message.
    * eeca31b Valentin Lab new: dev: use ``git-changelog`` section in ``git config`` world appropriately.
    * 6142b71 Valentin Lab chg: dev: cosmetic removal of trailing whitespaces
    * 3c3edd5 Valentin Lab fix: usr: ``git`` in later versions seems to fail on ``git config <key>`` with errlvl 255, that was not supported.
    * 3f9617d Valentin Lab fix: usr: removed Traceback when there were no tags at all in the current git repository.
    * e0db9ae Valentin Lab new: usr: added section classifiers (ie: New, Change, Bugs) and updated the sample rc file.  (0.1.1)
    * 0c66d59 Valentin Lab fix: dev: Fixed case where exception was thrown if two tags are on the same commit.
    * d2fae0d Valentin Lab new: usr: added a succint ``--help`` support.

And here is the ``gitchangelog`` output (in ReST format):

And the rendered full result is directly used to generate the HTML webpage of the `changelog of the PyPI page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitchangelog>`__.

Usage
-----

The `sample configuration file <http://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog/blob/master/gitchangelog.rc.sample>`__ is quite heavily commented and is quite simple. You should be able to use it as required.

The changelog of ``gitchangelog`` is generated with himself and with the sample configuration file. You'll see the output in the `changelog of the PyPI page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitchangelog>`__.

Templating system
-----------------

The output can be provided in different format. For the moment Markdown and ReSTructured text are supported.

The templates are located in ``share/templates`` are implemented thanks to `pystache <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache>`__ the python implementation of the `mustache <http://mustache.github.io/>`__ specifications.

``gitchangelog`` is constructing a data tree holding the elements that will be used to render the changelog using the provided templates.

If you want more information about mustache & pystache:

Changelog data tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To render the template, ``gitchangelog`` is generating a data tree that will then be used with the template to create the changelog.

Here is the structure of the changelog data tree:

::
