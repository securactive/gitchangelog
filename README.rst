Use your commit log to make beautifull and configurable changelog file.

***

**This fork adds warnings about reverted commits. The warning prevents you from accidentially announcing a commit that someone has reverted.**

***



Feature
=======

- fully driven by a config file that can be tailored with your changelog
  policies. (see for example the `sample configuration file`_)
- filter out commits/tags based on regexp matching
- refactor commit summary, or commit body on the fly with replace regexp
- classify commit message into sections (ie: New, Fix, Changes...)
- any output format supported thanks to templating, you can even choose
  your own preferred template engine (mako, mustache, full python ...).
- support your merge or rebase workflows and complicated git histories


Requirements
============

``gitchangelog`` is compatible Python 2 and Python 3.

It should work on Linux/BSD/MacOSX and any help with Windows
compatibility would be appreciated.

Please submit an issue if you encounter incompatibilies.


Sample
======

The default output is ReSTructured text, so it should be readable in ASCII.

Here is a small sample of the ``gitchangelog`` changelog at work.

Current ``git log`` output so you can get an idea of the log history::

  * 59f902a Valentin Lab new: dev: sections in changelog are now in the order given in ``gitchangelog.rc`` in the ``section_regexps`` option.  (0.1.2)
  * c6f72cc Valentin Lab chg: dev: commented code to toggle doctest mode.
  * a9c38f3 Valentin Lab fix: dev: doctests were failing on this.
  * 59524e6 Valentin Lab new: usr: added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly body of commit.
  * 5883f07 Valentin Lab new: usr: use a list of tuple instead of a dict for ``section_regexps`` to be able to manage order between section on find match.
  * 7c1d480 Valentin Lab new: dev: new ``unreleased_version_label`` option in ``gitchangelog.rc`` to change label of not yet released code.
  * cf29c9c Valentin Lab fix: dev: bad sorting of tags (alphanumerical). Changed to commit date sort.
  * 61d8f80 Valentin Lab fix: dev: support of empty commit message.
  * eeca31b Valentin Lab new: dev: use ``gitchangelog`` section in ``git config`` world appropriately.
  * 6142b71 Valentin Lab chg: dev: cosmetic removal of trailing whitespaces
  * 3c3edd5 Valentin Lab fix: usr: ``git`` in later versions seems to fail on ``git config <key>`` with errlvl 255, that was not supported.
  * 3f9617d Valentin Lab fix: usr: removed Traceback when there were no tags at all in the current git repository.
  * e0db9ae Valentin Lab new: usr: added section classifiers (ie: New, Change, Bugs) and updated the sample rc file.  (0.1.1)
  * 0c66d59 Valentin Lab fix: dev: Fixed case where exception was thrown if two tags are on the same commit.
  * d2fae0d Valentin Lab new: usr: added a succint ``--help`` support.

And here is the ``gitchangelog`` output::

  0.1.2 (2011-05-17)

And the rendered full result is directly used to generate the HTML webpage of
the `changelog of the PyPI page`_.


Usage
=====

You need to place a ``gitchangelog.rc`` file somewhere, the
recommended location is the root of the current git repository with
the name ``.gitchangelog.rc``.  However you could put it elsewhere,
and here are the locations checked (first match will prevail):

- in the path given thanks to the environment variable
  ``GITCHANGELOG_CONFIG_FILENAME``
- in the path stored in git config's entry ``gitchangelog.rc-path`` (which
  could be stored in system location or per repository)
- (RECOMMENDED) in the root of the current git repository with the name
  ``.gitchangelog.rc``

Then, you'll be able to call ``gitchangelog`` in a GIT repository and it'll
print changelog on its standard output.


Configuration file format
-------------------------

The `sample configuration file`_ is quite heavily commented and is quite
simple.  You should be able to use it as required.

.. _sample configuration file: http://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog/blob/master/gitchangelog.rc.reference

The changelog of gitchangelog is generated with himself and with the sample
configuration file. You'll see the output in the `changelog of the PyPI page`_.

.. _changelog of the PyPI page: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitchangelog


Output Engines
--------------

At the end of the configuration file, you'll notice a variable called
``output_engine``. By default, it's set to ``rest_py``, which is the
legacy python engine to produce the `ReSTructured Text` output format
that is shown in above samples. If this engine fits your needs, you
won't need to fiddle with this option.

To render the template, ``gitchangelog`` will generate a data structure that
will then be rendered thanks to the output engine. This should help you get
the exact output that you need.

As people might have different needs and knowledge, a templating
system using ``mustache`` is available. ``mustache`` templates are
provided to render both `ReSTructured Text` or `markdown` formats. If
you know ``mustache`` templating, then you could easily add or modify
these existing templates.

A ``mako`` templating engine is also provided. You'll find also a ``mako``
template producing the same `ReSTructured Text` output than the legacy one.
It's provided for reference and/or further tweak if you would rather use `mako`_
templates.


Mustache
~~~~~~~~

The ``mustache``  output engine uses `mustache templates`_.

The `mustache`_ templates for ``gitchangelog`` are located in
``templates/mustache`` and are powered via `pystache`_ the python
implementation of the `mustache`_ specifications. So `mustache`_ output engine
will only be available if you have `pystache`_ module available in your python
environment.

.. _mustache: http://mustache.github.io
.. _pystache: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache
.. _mustache templates: http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html


Mako
~~~~

The ``makotemplate`` output engine templates for ``gitchangelog`` are located in
``templates/mako`` and are powered via `mako`_ python templating system. So
`mako`_ output engine will only be available if you have `mako`_ module
available in your python environment.

.. _mako: http://www.makotemplates.org


Changelog data tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a sample of the current data structure sent to output engines::

  {'title': 'Changelog',
   'versions': [{'label': '%%version%% (unreleased)',
                 'date': None,
                 'tag': None
                 'sections': [{'label': 'Changes',
                               'commits': [{'author': 'John doe',
                                            'body': '',
                                            'subject': 'Adding some extra values.'},
                                           {'author': 'John Doe',
                                            'body': '',
                                            'subject': 'Some more changes'}]},
                              {'label': 'Other',
                               'commits': [{'author': 'Jim Foo',
                                            'body': '',
                                            'subject': 'classic modification'},
                                           {'author': 'Jane Done',
                                            'body': '',
                                            'subject': 'Adding some stuff to do.'}]}]},
                {'label': 'v0.2.5 (2013-08-06)',
                 'date': '2013-08-06',
                 'tag': 'v0.2.5'
                 'sections': [{'commits': [{'author': 'John Doe',
                                            'body': '',
                                            'subject': 'Updating Changelog installation.'}],
                               'label': 'Changes'}]}]}


Merged branches history support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commit attribution to a specific version could be tricky. Suppose you have
this typical merge tree (spot the tags!)::

    * new: something  (HEAD, tag: 0.2, develop)
    *   Merge tag '0.1.1' into develop
    |\
    | * fix: out-of-band hotfix  (tag: 0.1.1)
    * | chg: continued development
    |/
    * fix: something  (tag: 0.1)
    * first commit  (tag: 0.0.1, master)

Here's a minimal draft of gitchangelog to show how commit are
attributed to versions::

    0.2
      * new: something.
      * Merge tag '0.1.1' into develop.
      * chg: continued development.

    0.1.1
      * fix: out-of-band hotfix.

    0.1
      * fix: something.


.. note:: you can remove automatically all merge commit from
  gitchangelog output by using ``include_merge = False`` in the
  ``.gitchangelog.rc`` file.


Contributing
============

Any suggestion or issue is welcome. Push request are very welcome,
please check out the guidelines.


Push Request Guidelines
-----------------------

You can send any code. I'll look at it and will integrate it myself in
the code base while leaving you as the commit(s) author. This process
can take time and it'll take less time if you follow the following
guidelines:

- check your code with PEP8 or pylint. Try to stick to 80 columns wide.
- separate your commits per smallest concern
- each functionality/bugfix commit should contain the code, tests,
  and doc.
- each commit should pass the tests (to allow easy bisect)
- prior minor commit with typographic or code cosmetic changes are
  very welcome. These should be tagged in their commit summary with
  ``!minor``.
- the commit message should follow gitchangelog rules (check the git
  log to get examples)
- if the commit fixes an issue or finished the implementation of a
  feature, please mention it in the summary.

If you have some questions about guidelines which is not answered here,
please check the current ``git log``, you might find previous commit that
would show you how to deal with your issue. Otherwise, just send your PR
and ask your question. I won't bite. Promise.
